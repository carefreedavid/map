WIP. Map for choosing areas to target in JHB

html webpage that uses the google maps js api. 

"map.html" is all categories together. thereafter map_category.html files are self explanitory. 

all the correct files are accessable in the rebo. just simply run the map.html file and you can use the nav to see other categories.
